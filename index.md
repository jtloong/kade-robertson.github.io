----------

I am a computer science student at the University of Waterloo, currently doing work related to database 
management, and developing software for internal use to be used alongside our ERP software.

I have a project I have taken more seriously:

  - [AnimmexAPI](https://github.com/kade-robertson/AnimmexAPI), a C# wrapper for performing various actions 
    on Animmex, a Russian video streaming site. They currently have no official API, so this is a substitute.
 
A lot of my GitHub activity is based around esoteric programming languages. I have created interpreters for:

  - [Huh?](https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythuhn)
  - [Ook!](https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythook)
  - [Developers](https://github.com/kade-robertson/pydevelopers)

Furthermore, I have worked on developing my own, equally esoteric languages:

  - [lindenMASM + pylasma](https://github.com/kade-robertson/pylasma), pylasma being an interpreter for the
    LindenMASM programming language I created, specifically for the purposes of drawing Lindenmayer systems.
  - [stuck](https://github.com/kade-robertson/stuck), a stack-based code-golfing language, that is now famous
    for having the [shortest possible "Hello, World! solution](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/55425).
  - [haystack](https://github.com/kade-robertson/haystack), another stack-based language, however the source
    file is navigated in 2 dimensions, with full control over the direction. Execution ends when it finds the needle.
  - [tone-deaf](https://github.com/kade-robertson/tone-deaf), a third stack-based language, where the source
    code is intended to look like guitar chords (with optional lyrics).

Feel free to send me an email at the address above if you have any inquiries.
