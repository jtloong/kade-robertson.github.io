        <p>I am a computer science student at the University of Waterloo, currently doing work related to database 
           management, and developing software for internal use to be used alongside our ERP software.</p>
        <p>I have a project I have taken more seriously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/AnimmexAPI" target="_blank" >AnimmexAPI</a>, a C# wrapper 
		for performing various actions on Animmex, a Russian video streaming site. They currently have no 
		official API, so this is a substitute.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A lot of my GitHub activity is based around esoteric programming languages. I have created interpreters for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythuhn" target="_blank">Huh?</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pythook" target="_blank">Ook!</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pydevelopers" target="_blank">Developers</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore, I have worked on developing my own, equally esoteric languages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/pylasma" target="_blank">lindenMASM + pylasma</a>, pylasma 
		being an interpreter for the LindenMASM programming language I created, specifically for the purposes 
		of drawing Lindenmayer systems.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/stuck" target="_blank">stuck</a>, a stack-based code-golfing 
		language, that is now famous for having the <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/55425" target="_blank">
		shortest possible â€œHello, World! solution</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/haystack" target="_blank">haystack</a>, another stack-based 
		language, however the source file is navigated in 2 dimensions, with full control over the direction.
		Execution ends when it finds the needle in the haystack.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/tone-deaf" target="_blank">tone-deaf</a>, a third stack-based 
		language, where the source code is intended to look like guitar chords (with optional lyrics).</li>
        </ul>
	<p>There are also some projects that I have begun work on, but they have lost priority due to various issues, such as:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/kade-robertson/YTSDotNet" target="_blank">YTSDotNet</a>, a wrapper for the
		YTS API. Unfortunately, this hasn't been continued since, while there is documentation available, a lot
		of the "endpoints" for the API are dead links. If they are ever restored I will work on this further.</li>
	</ul>
